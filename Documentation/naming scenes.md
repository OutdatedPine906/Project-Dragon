# How to name unity scenes
## Do you need a new scene?
If your scene is small and is not entered 
by _joystick left/up_ you should **not** make a new scene
unless the new room is deemed incompatible with the environment.
## naming your scene
Your scene names use the following syntax:
Area/subarea/type(number) - name

Ex.
LostKingdom/Tutorial/MR(3) - Tutorial 

### room types
* MR - main room
* TR - transition room
* CR - central room
* P - passage
* SR - side room
* BR - battle room
* C - cinematic
* M - menu
* O - other
* VR - vertical room
